# Data_Analyst_Portfolio

## Overview

This portfolio will include projects that use languages such as SQL and Python as well as utilize other applications such as Tableau and Google Colaboratory. I will include a README file with every project giving an overview of what the project is about. Below I will include installation guides for all the software that was used.

## Installation

## Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio

SQL Server Management Studio is an integrated environment for managing your SQL Server infrastructure and Azure SQL Database.
Management Studio provides tools to configure, monitor, and administer instances of SQL Server.
It also provides tools to deploy, monitor, and upgrade the data-tier components, such as databases and data warehouses used by your applications, and to build queries and scripts.

## Supported SQL Server versions
This version of SSMS works with all supported versions of SQL Server (SQL Server 2008 - SQL Server 2017), and provides the greatest level of support for working with the latest cloud features in Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.
There is no explicit block for SQL Server 2000 or SQL Server 2005, but some features may not work properly.
Additionally, SSMS 17.x can be installed side-by-side with SSMS 16.X or SQL Server 2014 SSMS and earlier.


## Supported Operating systems
This release of **SSMS 17.x Version** supports the following platforms when used with the latest available service pack: Windows 10, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows 7 (SP1),  Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 (64-bit), Windows Server 2012 R2 (64-bit), Windows Server 2008 R2 (64-bit)

SSMS 18.x is not supported on Windows 8. Windows 10 / Windows Server 2016 requires version 1607 (10.0.14393) or later:
Due to the new dependency on NetFx 4.7.2, SSMS 18.0 does not install on Windows 8, older versions of Windows 10, and Windows Server 2016. SSMS setup will block on those operating systems. Windows 8.1 is still supported.
