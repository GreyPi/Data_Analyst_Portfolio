# Project 3 Overview

This project uses SQL to clean up the data found in the Nashville Housing Dataset. Comments are included with the SQL queries.
In this project I use SQL to stadardize data formats, populate missing data, splitting up data for more useability, remove duplicates,
and advance use of CTE. This project also includes possible configurations to a database for ETL.
