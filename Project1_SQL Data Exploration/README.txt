# Project 1 Overview

This project uses SQL to analyze Covid deaths and vaccinations data. The SQL queries
have supporting comments explaing what data is being gathered (Looking at cases vs deaths,
infections rates, death counts, etc.) The datasets are provided in two file formats
because the server I was using wanted them in .xlsx format.
